# Analysis of Tuberculosis Cases in Modern History

### Project Overview 

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the amount of and rates of Tuberculosis cases from 2000-2024. Analysis begins with global data and is then filtered down to only United States, and finally just California, where tuberculosis cases are reported in media to be significantly increasing in 2023 and 2024. Seeking to identify trends between geographic location and other demographic factors. 


### Data Sources
Global dataset: First data set used pertained to global tuberculosis cases and was named 'incidenceoftuberculosis.csv'. 

USA data set: Data set used to compare geographic locations within the United States of America. File was named 'USA_tuberculosis.csv'. Data retrieved from data.gov under "NNDS - Table III. Tuberculosis".

California data set: This set contained information about cases in California and included demographics of patients including age group, sex, ethnicity, citizen status, etc. File was named 'tb-case-rates-in-ca.csv'. Data retrieved from data.gov "tuberculosis case numbers and rates, california and local health jurisdictions" report.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation state, I performed the following steps for each of the data sources I compiled:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Identifiying relevant data
3. Data cleaning and formatting
   

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to answer a few key questions such as:
- Which regions showed highest cases of tuberculosis?
- What years showed the highest number of cases of tuberculosis?
- What are the trends for high case regions and the time periods at which they occured?
